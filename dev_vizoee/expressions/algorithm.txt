values:
    current symbol
    processing number

for each symbol:
    if number or .:
        if last symbol's first value is number:
            add it to last symbol
        else
            make new symbol
    else:
        make new symbol


V2
use Castor's Gambit as a way to have states - state machine
    push index of commands that should be run
    index 0 is ismply selecting correct command
    all commands should fall back to index 0 if they fail or complete

handlers:
numbers:
    converts string to number
    runs as long as symbol is part of numbers (0123456789 and .)
    does not validate if number is correct (but can by checking if null)
functions
    parses functions
    contains list of all functions (probably good idea to make tree out of it with leafs as results)
    traverses tree until finds leaf or miss
        leaf - success, pastes result
        miss - fail, parses as variable and/or errors if len > 1
variables
    converts char/string to variable/list of variables
operators (could argue that they are part of functions)
    +-==()
